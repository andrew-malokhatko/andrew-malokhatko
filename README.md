# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Andrew**, a Computer Science student from **Ukraine** currently studying at the **Slovak University of Technology**.
Hereâ€™s some more info about me:

- I mainly use C++ paired with CMake for my projects (sometimes java).
- I have solved over 100 leetcode problems.
- I love programming games.
- I find low-level code intersting (e.g Operating systems)

Check out my best projects: royale, chess-engine and tower-defense.
